🩺 HealthAI - IBM Granite-Powered Medical Assistant
HealthAI is a smart, interactive medical assistant built with Gradio and powered by IBM Granite 3.3-2B Instruct via Hugging Face Transformers. It provides symptom analysis, natural remedies, medication guidance, and disease information in a friendly and accessible format. This AI system aims to offer initial insights into common health concerns—but never replaces professional medical advice.

🚀 Features
1.🔍 Symptom Analysis: Understand possible conditions from described symptoms

2.🌿 Home Remedies: Get natural, evidence-based suggestions for common illnesses

3.💊 Medication Guide: View conventional treatments with disclaimers

4.💬 Disease Explanation: Understand complex medical conditions in simple language

5.🧠 Powered by LLM: Uses IBM's Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct with 4-bit quantized loading for optimized performance

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/HealthAI.git
cd HealthAI

2. Install Dependencies
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.

pip install -r requirements.txt
If running in a Jupyter Notebook, you may use !pip install inline instead.

3. Authenticate Hugging Face
Before using the model, log in to your Hugging Face account:

from huggingface_hub import notebook_login
notebook_login()
Paste your Hugging Face token when prompted.

4. Run the App
Run via terminal or notebook:
python health_ai.py
Or, from notebook:
app.launch(share=True, debug=True)

🧠 How It Works
HealthAI uses prompt engineering with an instruction-tuned large language model (IBM Granite-3.3-2B-Instruct) to:

1.Interpret symptom descriptions and suggest likely conditions

2.Recommend safe home remedies based on natural medicine sources

3.Describe treatment options with disclaimers

4.Explain medical terms and illnesses in layman's terms

All prompts are passed through a single generation pipeline using Hugging Face's generate() method.
